# Solar-System-using-java3D
A replica of our solar system that closely represents the real solar system. 
This is a quick guide to help you run the solar system program on your machine. Firstly, you
would need to create a java project then create two folders and five classes.
Folder1: models //this folder will contain the texture images and objects
Folder2: sounds //this folder will contain the sounds and music used in this project
Class1: SolarSystem //This is the main class where everything will be ran
Class2: SolarSysShapes //The shapes class
Class3: CommonsMA //colors and behaviors
Class4: Codes4SS //this class shows multiple views of the solar system at the same time
Class5: SoundUtilityJOAL //sound methods
Note: the orbit lines of the planets are disabled by default thus if you want to see the orbits you
need to uncomment one line. Indicated by a blue arrow.
You need to make sure you have the necessary jars to run java3d programs.
Use of Mouse and Keyboard:
The X key enables and disables a background music and the A, S, W, & D keys allow for free
navigation inside the universe. On the other hand, you can use the mouse to rotate the entire solar
system and when you click on a planet with the mouse a sound will play telling you the planet’s
name and a fun fact about that planet
